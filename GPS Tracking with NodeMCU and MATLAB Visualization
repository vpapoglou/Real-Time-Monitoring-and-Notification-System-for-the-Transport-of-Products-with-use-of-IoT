//GPS Tracking with NodeMCU and MATLAB Visualization
//In ThingSpeak we can create Map Visualizations in order to track the location of a cargo at a specific time. We create MATLAB Visualization and through code we can choose which //variables to show(e.g. Temperature), including the Latitude and Longitude variables for printing a mark on the map.
