/* GPS Tracking with NodeMCU and MATLAB Visualization
In ThingSpeak we can create Map Visualizations in order to track the location of a cargo at a specific time. We create MATLAB Visualization and through code we can choose which variables to show(e.g. Temperature), including the Latitude and Longitude variables for printing a mark on the map.
For easy testing we could send data manually to our ThingSpeak variables through the browser: (in my case field4 was the longitude, field3 the latitude and field1 the temperature)

// the <'NumPoints',3> indicates that the last 3 values will be shown
lat = thingSpeakRead(yourChannelID,'Fields',3,'ReadKey','yourReadKey','NumPoints',3,'Timeout',50);
lon = thingSpeakRead(yourChannelID,'Fields',4,'ReadKey','yourReadKey','NumPoints',3,'Timeout',50);
temp = thingSpeakRead(yourChannelID,'Fields',1,'ReadKey','yourReadKey','NumPoints',3,'Timeout',50);
//red indicated the color of marks and filled indicates how the mark will look like 
geoscatter(lat,lon,temp,'red','filled');
geobasemap('streets');
