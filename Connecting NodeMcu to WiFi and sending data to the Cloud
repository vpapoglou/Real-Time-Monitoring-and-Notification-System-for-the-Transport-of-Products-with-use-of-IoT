//Connecting NodeMcu to WiFi and sending data to the Cloud
//This code first connects NodeMcu to WiFi and then sends the data to the ThingSpeak page. At https://thingspeak.com/ we can create a Channel that will have its own fields, graphs //and API keys so we can do our own updates. So, in the code we need to add the WiFi name and code as well as the Channel ID and the Write API Key of ThingSpeak. Finally, we upload //the code to NodeMcu by selecting "NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)" as a board tool.
