/* MATLAB Visualization with scaling
This is a different version of the previous one. The marks on the map are as big as the value of a variable that we choose. In this case the mark is as big as the value of temperature.
For easy testing we could send data manually to our ThingSpeak variables through the browser: (in my case field4 was the longitude, field3 the latitude and field1 the temperature)
https://api.thingspeak.com/update?api_key=yourWriteAPIKey&field4=?&field3=?&field1=? */

// the <'NumPoints',3> indicates that the last 3 values will be shown
lat = thingSpeakRead(yourChannelID,'Fields',3,'ReadKey','yourReadKey','NumPoints',3,'Timeout',50);
lon = thingSpeakRead(yourChannelID,'Fields',4,'ReadKey','yourReadKey','NumPoints',3,'Timeout',50);
temp = thingSpeakRead(yourChannelID,'Fields',1,'ReadKey','yourReadKey','NumPoints',3,'Timeout',50);
//indicate how map will look like
geobasemap('streets');
geobubble(lat,lon,temp,zoom=5);
