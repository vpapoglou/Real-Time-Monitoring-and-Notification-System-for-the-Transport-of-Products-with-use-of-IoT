//MATLAB Visualization with scaling
//This is a different version of the previous one. The marks on the map are as big as the value of a variable that we choose. In this case the mark is as big as the value of //temperature.
//For easy testing we could send data manually to our ThingSpeak variables through the browser:
//https://api.thingspeak.com/update?api_key=yourWriteAPIKey&field4=?&field3=?&field1=?
